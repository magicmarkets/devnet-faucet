# magic.markets devnet faucet

[magic.markets](https://magic.markets/) is using a custom token instead of USDC
or Bitcoin on devnet that you will need to test the protocol. We call this token
still USD as it substitutes a stablecoin on mainnet for testing. This faucet
mints 100 tokens for every 1 devnet SOL sent to it. Our escrow token has a
fungability of 6 decimals to mimic USDC.
